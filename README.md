# Web LLM
| [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mlc-ai/web-llm) | [Get Started](#get-started) | [MLC LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm) | [Discord][discord-url]

WebLLM is a modular, customizable javascript package that directly
bring language model chats directly onto web browsers with hardware acceleration.
**Everything runs inside the browser with no server support and accelerated with WebGPU.**
We can bring a lot of fun opportunities to build AI assistants for everyone and enable privacy while enjoying GPU acceleration.

**[Check out our demo webpage to try out!](https://mlc.ai/web-llm/)**
This project is a companion project of [MLC LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm),
our companion project that runs LLMs natively on iphone and other native local environments.

## Get Started

WebLLM offers a minimalist and modular interface to access the chatbot in browser.
The following code demonstrates the basic usage.

```typescript
import { ChatModule } from "@mlc-ai/web-llm";

async function main() {
  const chat = new ChatModule();
  // load a prebuilt model
  await chat.reload("RedPajama-INCITE-Chat-3B-v1-q4f32_0");
  // generate a reply base on input
  const prompt = "What is the capital of Canada?";
  const reply = await chat.generate(prompt);
  console.log(reply);
}
```

The WebLLM package itself does not come with UI, and is designed in a
modular way to hooked to any of the UI component. The following code snippet
is contains part of the program that generate streaming response on a webpage.
You can checkout [examples/get-started](examples/get-started/) to see the complete example.

```typescript
async function main() {
  // create a ChatModule,
  const chat = new ChatModule();
  // This callback allows us to report initialization progress
  chat.setInitProgressCallback((report: InitProgressReport) => {
    setLabel("init-label", report.text);
  });
  // pick a model, here we use red-pajama
  const localId = "RedPajama-INCITE-Chat-3B-v1-q4f32_0";
  await chat.reload(localId);

  // callback to refresh the streaming response
  const generateProgressCallback = (_step: number, message: string) => {
    setLabel("generate-label", message);
  };
  const prompt0 = "What is the capital of Canada?";
  // generate  response
  const reply0 = await chat.generate(prompt0, generateProgressCallback);
  console.log(reply0);

  const prompt1 = "How about France?";
  const reply1 = await chat.generate(prompt1, generateProgressCallback)
  console.log(reply1);

  // We can print out the statis
  console.log(await chat.runtimeStatsText());
}
```

Finally, you can find a complete
You can also find a complete chat-app in [examples/simple-chat](examples/simple-chat/).

## Customized Model Weights

WebLLM works a companion project of [MLC LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm).
It reuses the model artifact and build flow of MLC LLM, please checkout MLC LLM document
on how to build a new model weights and libraries (MLC LLM document will come in the incoming weeks).
To generate the wasm needed by WebLLM, you can run with `--target webgpu` in the mlc llm build.
There are two elements of WebLLM package that enables new models and weight variants.

- model_url: Contains a URL to model artifacts, such as weights and meta-data.
- model_lib: The webassembly libary that contains the executables to accelerate the model computations.

Both are customizable in the WebLLM.

```typescript
async main() {
  const myLlamaUrl = "/url/to/my/llama";
  const appConfig = {
	"model_list": [
		{
			"model_url": myLlamaUrl,
			"local_id": "MyLlama-3b-v1-q4f32_0"
		}
	],
	"model_lib_map": {
		"llama-v1-3b-q4f32_0": "/url/to/myllama3b.wasm",
	}
  };
  // override default
  const chatOpts = {
    "repetition_penalty": 1.01
  };

  const chat = new ChatModule();
  // load a prebuilt model
  // with a chat option override and app config
  // under the hood, it will load the model from myLlamaUrl
  // and cache it in the browser cache
  //
  // Let us assume that myLlamaUrl/mlc-config.json contains a model_lib
  // field that points to "llama-v1-3b-q4f32_0"
  // then chat module will initialize with these information
  await chat.reload("MyLlama-3b-v1-q4f32_0", chatOpts, appConfig);
}
```

In many cases we only want to supply the model weight variant, but
not necessarily a new model. In such cases, we can reuse the model lib.
In such cases, we can just pass in the `model_list` field and skip the model lib,
and make sure the `mlc-chat-config.json` in the model url have a model lib
that points to a prebuilt version, right now the prebuilt lib includes

- `vicuna-v1-7b-q4f32_0`: llama-7b models.
- `RedPajama-INCITE-Chat-3B-v1-q4f32_0`: RedPajama-3B variant.


## Build WebLLM Package From Source

WebLLM package is a web runtime designed for [MLC LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm).

1. Install all the prerequisite for web deployment:
    1. [emscripten](https://emscripten.org). It is an LLVM-based compiler which compiles C/C++ source code to WebAssembly.
        - Follow the [installation instruction](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html#installation-instructions-using-the-emsdk-recommended) to install the latest emsdk.
        - Source `emsdk_env.sh` by `source path/to/emsdk_env.sh`, so that `emcc` is reachable from PATH and the command `emcc` works.
    4. Install jekyll by following the [official guides](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). It is the package we use for website.
    5. Install jekyll-remote-theme by command. Try [gem mirror](https://gems.ruby-china.com/) if install blocked.
        ```shell
        gem install jekyll-remote-theme
        ```
    We can verify the success installation by trying out `emcc` and `jekyll` in terminal respectively.

2. Setup necessary environment

    Prepare all the necessary dependencies for web build:
    ```shell
    ./scripts/prep_deps.sh
    ```

3. Buld WebLLM Package

    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```

4. Validate some of the sub packages

    You can then go to the subfolders in [examples] to validate some of the sub packages.
    We use Parcelv2 for bundling. Although parcel is not very good at tracking parent directory
    changes sometimes. When you made a change in the WebLLM package, try to edit the `package.json`
    of the subfolder and save it, which will trigger Parcel to rebuild.


## How

The key technology here is machine learning compilation (MLC). Our solution builds on the shoulders of the open source ecosystem, including Hugging Face, model variants from LLaMA and Vicuna, wasm and WebGPU. The main flow builds on Apache TVM Unity, an exciting ongoing development in the [Apache TVM Community](https://github.com/apache/tvm/).

- We bake a language model's IRModule in TVM with native dynamic shape support, avoiding the need of padding to max length and reducing both computation amount and memory usage.
- Each function in TVMâ€™s IRModule can be further transformed and generate runnable code that can be deployed universally on any environment that is supported by minimum tvm runtime (JavaScript being one of them).
- [TensorIR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04296) is the key technique used to generate optimized programs. We provide productive solutions by quickly transforming TensorIR programs based on the combination of expert knowledge and automated scheduler.
- Heuristics are used when optimizing light-weight operators in order to reduce the engineering pressure.
- We utilize int4 quantization techniques to compress the model weights so that they can fit into memory.
- We build static memory planning optimizations to reuse memory across multiple layers.
- We use [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) and TypeScript to build a TVM web runtime that can deploy generated modules.
- We also leveraged a wasm port of SentencePiece tokenizer.

All parts of this workflow are done in Python, with the exception of course, of the last part that builds a 600 loc JavaScript app that connects things together. This is also a fun process of interactive development, bringing new models.

All these are made possible by the open-source ecosystem that we leverage. Specifically, we make heavy use of [TVM unity](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/establish-tvm-unity-connection-a-technical-strategy/13344), an exciting latest development in the TVM project that enables such Python-first interactive MLC development experiences that allows us to easily compose new optimizations, all in Python, and incrementally bring our app to the web.

TVM unity also provides an easy way to compose new solutions in the ecosystem. We will continue to bring further optimizations such as fused quantization kernels, and bring them to more platforms.

One key characteristic of LLM models is the dynamic nature of the model. As the decoding and prefill process depends on computations that grow with the size of tokens, we leverage the first-class dynamic shape support in TVM unity that represents sequence dimensions through symbolic integers. This allows us to plan ahead to statically allocate all the memory needed for the sequence window of interest without padding.

We also leveraged the integration of tensor expressions to quickly express partial-tensor computations such as rotary embedding directly without materializing them into full-tensor matrix computations.
